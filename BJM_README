Calendar??
we're gonna go with 

http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/datePicker/v2/demo/index.html


We start with all days closed. So users must open a calendar date. 
Unblocked calendar dates are specified by an Unblock object
which has a user_id and a date for the start of that week, a bitarray.

The bitarray has a bit for each day of the week, plus two for saturday. So we can treat it like an 8 day week. 
So we just need an INT(8).

Then all we need for named scope is to input a day, and output a condition that searches IN() + plus the target week. 

That seems reasonable.
